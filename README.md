# DP-GANs: Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Networks

This repository contains an implementation of **Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Networks (DP-GANs)**. DP-GANs are a variant of GANs that integrate differential privacy techniques into the training process to provide guarantees about the privacy of individual data points in the dataset.

In this project, we explore how to train GANs with privacy-preserving methods and demonstrate the implementation using synthetic data.

## Features
- **Differential Privacy Integration**: Provides privacy guarantees for data during training.
- **GAN Framework**: Utilizes GAN architecture for generating synthetic data.
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Demonstrates the privacy-preserving GANs using synthetic datasets.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DP-GANs.git
